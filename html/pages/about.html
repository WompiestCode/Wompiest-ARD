      Hey there! We’re <strong>jm&JM</strong> — the duo behind <em>WOMP // ARD</em>.
      We’re Computer Science and IT students exploring the intersection of <strong>code</strong>, <strong>creativity</strong>, and <strong>design</strong>.
      This is where we share our journey through tech, digital art, and the ideas that shape our world.
    </p>

    <p>
      We’re always experimenting — whether it’s building something cool with code or designing visuals that tell a story.
      <br>
      <strong>WOMP // ARD</strong> is our creative lab — a place to share our projects, thoughts, and the little wins that keep us motivated in the world of tech.
